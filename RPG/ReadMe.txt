[h1]About this overhaul[/h1]
The idea of this mod was born out of my passion for oldschool rpg games.
I thought it would be cool to develop every single soldier in every way you want and give it every weapon or item you want. 

So here it is. The mod replaces the vanilla class by one class starting as "Soldier".

The Soldier class can use every weapon (supporting Primary Secondaries, LW2 Secondary Weapons).

This class has 14 rows of abilities (named specializations) with 7 ranks each (98 abilities total) to choose from. I am planning to even expand on this.

When your soldier evolves your class name and icon changes dynamically to the specialization you have the most perks from.

On squaddie your soldier will get two random starting abilities from a pool to give each soldier an idea to where he/she could be developed.

Any combination of abilities and weapons are possible. For example you can create a cannon wielding medic, a gunslinging grenadier, sniper with ripjack or whatever you can imagine.

Most abilities work with each weapon, the secondary weapon abilities work with their associated secondary regardless if it is in the primary or secondary.

Another big change is the possibility to upgrade the soldiers stats with ability points. Therefor i designed a completely new ui screen.

For overall balance and because i wanted to i overhauled the weapon mechanics and how most weapon attachments work.

After that delete %User\Documents\My Games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\Config

[b]Will custom class mods work with this?[/b]
There are some issues with ability restrictions applying to other classes.
Classes with only custom abilities should works though.
If you want to remove the ability restrictions you can delete the lines starting with
+AbilityPrerequisites...
and
+MutuallyExclusiveAbilities...
from the XComRPG.ini 
This is on your own risk, because some restrictions are there to prevent ability incompatibilities or broken ability combinations.

[b]What about Faction Heros, SPARKS, Psi Soldiers?[/b]
They are not touched by this mod and should work normally

[b]My soldier keep getting promited to basegame/other classes?[/b]
Its a strange bug cause by the config system for some people.
Use the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148535137] Disable Any Class Wotc[/url] and disable all classes but UniversalSoldier in the ingame mod options.

[b]I have a lot of plugins and the promotion screen skips specializations when scrolling[/b]
Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131906393] [WoTC] Row-Based Scrolling Speed Wotc[/url]

[h1]Mod compatibility[/h1]
Most mods should be compatible. If you have an issue let me know.
Other Overhaul mods like MINT and A Better Barracks obviously clash in some areas.

Known incompatibilities:
- "Configure Upgrade Slots" doesnt work cause this mod set all slots to 3
- "Hack Plus" leads to insane high hacking stats
- I am the commander here

[h1]A note on the beta status[/h1]
This mod will change frequently.
Therefor it might be needed that you rebuild you soldiers.
Use the command RebuildSelectedSoldiersClass from the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1370543410] Additional Soldier Console Commands[/url]
for that purpose.
