[h1]About this overhaul[/h1]
The mod replaces the vanilla class by one class starting as "Soldier".

The Soldier class can use every weapon (supporting Primary Secondaries, LW2 Secondary Weapons).

This class has 14 rows of abilities (named specializations) with 7 ranks each (98 abilities total) to choose from.
There a lot of plugin mods that you can use to add to this: [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1404633593]plugin in mod collection[/url][/u]

When your soldier evolves your class name and icon changes dynamically to the specialization you have the most perks from.

On squaddie your soldier will get two random starting abilities from a pool to give each soldier an idea to where he/she could be developed.

With second wave options you can limit the available specialization to some randomly chosen or picked (or even a combination of some picked and some random) specializations.
More info on swo [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1280477867/1653297026045137844/]HERE[/url][/u]

Any combination of abilities and weapons are possible. For example you can create a cannon wielding medic, a gunslinging grenadier, sniper with ripjack or whatever you can imagine.

Most abilities work with each weapon, the secondary weapon abilities work with their associated secondary regardless if it is in the primary or secondary.

Another big change is the possibility to upgrade the soldiers stats with ability points. Therefor i designed a completely new ui screen.

For overall balance and because i wanted to i overhauled the weapon mechanics and how most weapon attachments work.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]

[b]Do i need to start a new campaign for this?[/b]

Yes!

[b]I only see the first 4 ability rows and can't scroll in the promotion screen![/b]

DEACTIVATE THE FOLLOWING MODS SINCE THEY ARE ALREADY INTEGRATED IN THIS MOD

[list]
[*] [WOTC] Detailed Soldier Lists
[*] [WOTC] New Promotion Screen by Default
[*] View Locked Skills - Wotc
[/list]

After that delete %User\Documents\My Games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\Config

[b]Will custom class mods work with this?[/b]
Yes

[b]What about Faction Heros, SPARKS, Psi Soldiers?[/b]
They are not touched by this mod and should work normally

[b]My soldier keep getting promoted to basegame/other classes?[/b]
Its a strange bug cause by the config system for some people.
Use the mod [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148535137] Disable Any Class Wotc[/url][/u] and disable all classes but UniversalSoldier in the ingame mod options.

[b]I have a lot of plugins and the promotion screen skips specializations when scrolling[/b]
Use [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131906393] [WoTC] Row-Based Scrolling Speed Wotc[/url][/u]
or consider using the second wave options to limit the available specs.

[h1]Mod compatibility[/h1]
Most mods should be compatible. If you have an issue let me know.
Other Overhaul mods like MINT and A Better Barracks obviously clash in some areas.

Known incompatibilities:
- [WOTC] Detailed Soldier Lists
- [WOTC] New Promotion Screen by Default
- View Locked Skills - Wotc
- "Configure Upgrade Slots" doesnt work cause this mod set all slots to 3
- "Hack Plus" leads to insane high hacking stats

[h1]A note on the beta status[/h1]
This mod will change frequently.
Therefor it might be needed that you rebuild you soldiers.
Use the command RPGO_RebuildSelectedSoldier for that purpose.
